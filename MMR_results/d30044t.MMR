Turkey has asked for Ocalan's extradition.
INNSBRUCK, Austria (AP) -- Italian authorities have turned back at least 136 people along the Austro-Italian border during an immigration crackdown prompted by the arrest of Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan, Austrian officials said Monday.
He is viewed in Turkey as a terrorist.
"We have repeatedly brought attention to the problems created by the blatant violation of human rights in southeast Turkey," government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said late Saturday.
Turkish authorities negotiated with an imprisoned mob leader for a second day Monday to secure the release of an Italian inmate held hostage to pressure Italy into extraditing a Kurdish rebel leader, a prosecutor said.
