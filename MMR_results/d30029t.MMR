Seven others on board were taken to a hospital by helicopter, the center said.
The yacht, which has a crew of 11, was halfway across Bass Strait when it overturned.
A total of 37 yachts have been forced out of the 1,160-kilometer (725-mile) race.
The yacht's owner-skipper Bruce Guy and first-time race participant Phil Skeggs were killed.
Campbell was in the water for about 40 minutes and had hypothermia when he was taken to safety by Senior Constable Barry Barclay, who dropped into large swells to secure Campbell.
Despite the conditions, Peter Campbell said it was unlikely the race would be called off.
