He has remained in office as caretaker prime minister since Lahoud succeeded Hrawi on Tuesday.
The offer came after the 128 legislators polled by the president gave Hariri a majority but fell short of the near unanimous backing he had received in his previous three mandates since 1992.
Similar political disputes in Lebanon in the past have been solved only with the intervention of Syria, the main power broker in this country.
The sources close to Hariri, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the prime minister's decision to bow out came because he did not feel Lahoud was following constitutional procedures in selecting the premier.
