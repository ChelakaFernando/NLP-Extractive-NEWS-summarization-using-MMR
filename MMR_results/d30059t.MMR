Galina Starovoitova was one, and her murder in St. Petersburg on Friday was a terrible loss for Russia.
For now, the only thing certain is the Starovoitova has become the latest in a long line of Russian martyrs.
An open casket, cloaked with black ribbons and flanked by a military honor guard, stood at the head of the hall.
In recent weeks she had spoken out forcefully against political extremism, denounced the anti-Semitic statements of a Communist parliamentarian and was campaigning aggressively against financial corruption in the St. Petersburg municipal government.
Starovoitova's murder had all the traits of a contract murder, an increasingly common crime in Russia.
