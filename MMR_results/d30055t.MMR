Prodi has said he would call a confidence vote if he lost the Communists' support.
He relied on a fringe Marxist group, the Communist Refounding Party, for a majority in the lower house.
"The country needs stability and credibility, and that will never happen as long as the government is hanging from a thread."
"They have won by the treachery of one single person," Sergio Mattarella, a deputy in Prodi's coalition, angrily told reporters, referring to Silvio Liotta, a member of the Italian Renewal Party.
But his fiscal discipline was not followed by reform of a political system that is inherently fragile.
