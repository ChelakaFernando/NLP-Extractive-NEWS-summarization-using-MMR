"It is a peaceful protest against Australia training Indonesian soldiers," spokesman Jason McLeod said.
The EU statement also urged Indonesia to bring about a "real and substantial reduction" in troop levels and called for the establishment of a permanent U.N. presence in East Timor.
Organizers of Monday's strike had called for a non-violent "day of mourning."
