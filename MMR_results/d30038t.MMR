Hodler said a group of four agents, including one IOC member, have been involved in promising votes for payment.
Samaranch noted the IOC could adopt the formula used by sports federations such as FIFA, world soccer's governing body, which assign their executive boards to select sites.
The IOC also ruled out any possibility of stripping Salt Lake City of the games over alleged rules violations during the bid.
"The system we have now is very complicated, very slow and very expensive," he said.
"Never, never, is anyone thinking to expel Mr. Hodler," Samaranch said.
Samaranch expressed surprise at allegations made by the IOC executive board member Marc Hodler of Switzerland that agents were offering to sell I.O.C.
