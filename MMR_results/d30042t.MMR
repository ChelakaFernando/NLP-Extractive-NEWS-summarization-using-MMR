He said he spoke with Annan on Sunday and was "very encouraged by what he tells me."
On Sunday, state-run Libyan Radio quoted an unnamed official in the Foreign Liaison Secretariat, which is the equivalent of a foreign ministry, as saying that "a solution to this crisis is within reach."
The 60-year-old Annan is trying to get Libya to go along with a U.S.-British plan to try the two suspects before a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland.
"Libya has also agreed to a trial in a third country and believes that it ought to be possible to find answers to all other outstanding issues," he said.
