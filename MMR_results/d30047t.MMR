Built by a Russian company and to be launched atop a Russian booster rocket, the 24-ton Zarya (Sunrise) control and cargo module is a U.S.-funded component of the station.
Currie positioned the solar-winged Zarya, still on the end of the shuttle robot arm, several inches directly above Unity.
The launch of the first segment was postponed repeatedly, mainly because the chronically broke Russian space agency couldn't afford to complete another part of the station that is to go up later.
The 36-foot, 25,000-pound Unity will serve as a connecting passageway, or vestibule, for future modules.
It was the first time that the Russian-built Zarya control module and the made-in-America Unity chamber had ever touched.
