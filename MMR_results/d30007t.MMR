Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a counteroffensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo.
Rebel leaders said a victory at Kindu would confirm rebel strength, boost fighters' morale and perhaps persuade others to join them.
"Kindu is effectively in the hands of the FAC, which has now launched an offensive after defending its positions," said a ministry statement broadcast on state-run television.
Fighting in Kindu, 32 kilometers (20 miles) northeast of the Elila River bridge, died down after the rebels fired a barrage of artillery into the government-held quarters and the air base, four kilometers (two miles) away.
