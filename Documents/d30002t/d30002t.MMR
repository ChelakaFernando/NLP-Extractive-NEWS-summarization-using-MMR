Hurricane Mitch paused in its whirl through the western Caribbean on Wednesday to punish Honduras with 120-mph (205-kph) winds, topping trees, sweeping away bridges, flooding neighborhoods and killing at least 32 people. Rain-swollen rivers knocked out bridges and roads, isolating La Ceiba, a coastal city of 40,000 people located 80 miles (128 kilometers) from the Bay Islands. La Ceiba officials appealed for pure water for those in shelters and some residents set out plastic buckets to collect rainwater. Aid workers struggled Friday to reach survivors of Hurricane Mitch, who are in danger of dying from starvation and disease in the wake of the storm that officials estimate killed more than 10,000 people. "And God help us."
