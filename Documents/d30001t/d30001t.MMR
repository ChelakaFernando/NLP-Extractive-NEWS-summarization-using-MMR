Ranariddh told reporters Wednesday that he believed it was safe for Sam Rainsy in Cambodia. The killings of nearly 100 of Ranariddh's supporters documented by U.N. human rights workers in the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications meant to distort the political situation. Disputes over the presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form a new government. After a series of border clashes, the Khmer Rouge was ousted from power by an invading Vietnamese army that set up a surrogate Cambodian communist government later led by Hun Sen. The opposition claims the grenade attack was staged as an excuse to begin the crackdown.
